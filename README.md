# HackerRank
All code I have completed for hacker rank challenges.
This repository has code for each challenge I have completed through Hacker Rank, each of which should 
have been written in C. 
I wanted a nice clean way to view and display the physical code/solutions I have written for each challenge without 
having to view each individual assignment on the website itself, which can get a little tedious to go
through each one. 

Each file in the repository is named exactly after the challenge it solves in Hacker Rank.
